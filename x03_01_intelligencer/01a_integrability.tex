The EB is a 4-dimensional Hamiltonian System, the only planar Billiard known to be integrable \cite{jovanovic11}. This means the particle's path can be explicitly obtained in terms of two Integrals of Motion: (i) Energy (constant velocity with elastic collisions), and (ii) Joachimsthal's (product of angular momenta with respect to the foci \cite{birkhoff1927,sergei91}). The EB can be regarded as a special case of {\em Poncelet's Porism} \cite{dragovic11},  Figure~\ref{fig:poncelet-porism}.

Let the boundary of the EB satisfy $f(x,y)=(x/a)^2+(y/b)^2=1$, where $(a,b)$ are the semi-axes. Continuously, Joachimsthal's Integral implies the trajectory remains tangent to a confocal Caustic (for triangular trajectories, see Figure~\ref{fig:three-orbits}). At the bounces $P_i=(x_i,y_i)$, it implies a quantity $\gamma$ is invariant, given by a remarkable expression:

%
\begin{equation}
 \gamma=\frac{1}{2}\hat{v}.\nabla{f_i}=\mbox{constant} >0,\,\,\,\mbox{for all }{i}\;,
 \label{eqn:joachim}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\hat{v}$ is the normalized incoming velocity vector, and:

\begin{equation}
\nabla{f_i}=2\left(\frac{x_i}{a^2}\,,\frac{y_i}{b^2}\right).
\label{eqn:f}
\end{equation}

Constant energy and $\gamma$ constrain the space of trajectories to an abstract 2-torus \cite{sergei91} where the motion has constant frequencies in suitable angular coordinates. When frequencies are rationally-related, the motion is closed and the family has constant period, implying:

\begin{property}
The family of $N$-periodic trajectories has constant perimeter $L$.
\end{property}

Indeed, $L$ and $\gamma$ only depend on $a,b$. For $N=3$ explicit expressions have been derived \cite{ronaldo19,ronaldo19a}.
