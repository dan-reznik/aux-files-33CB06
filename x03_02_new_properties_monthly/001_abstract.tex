New invariants in the one-dimensional family of 3-periodic orbits in the elliptic billiard were introduced by the authors in "Can the Elliptic Billiard Still Surprise Us?"  (2020) \textit{Math. Intelligencer} 42(1): 6--17, some of which were generalized to $N>3$. Invariants mentioned there included ratios of radii and/or areas, sum of angle cosines, and a special stationary circle. Here we present some of the proofs omitted there as well as a few new related facts. \\
