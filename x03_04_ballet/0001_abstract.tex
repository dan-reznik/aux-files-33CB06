We explore a bevy of new phenomena displayed by 3-periodics in the Elliptic Billiard, including (i) their dynamic geometry and (ii) the non-monotonic motion of certain Triangle Centers constrained to the Billiard boundary. Fascinating is the {\em joint} motion of certain pairs of centers, whose many stops-and-gos are akin to a Ballet.
