A Circumconic passes through a triangle's vertices; an Inconic is tangent to the sidelines. We study the variable geometry of certain conics derived from the 1d family of 3-periodics in the Elliptic Billiard. Some display intriguing invariances such as aspect ratio and pairwise ratio of focal lengths. We also define the Circumbilliard, a circumellipse to a generic triangle for which the latter is a 3-periodic.
