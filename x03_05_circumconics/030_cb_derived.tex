\subsection{Excentral Triangle}
\label{sec:cb_exc}

The locus of the Excenters is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cb_trio} (left). It is an ellipse similar to the $90^\circ$-rotated locus of $X_1$ and its axes $a_e,b_e$ are given by \cite{garcia2019-incenter,garcia2020-ellipses}:

\begin{equation*}
 a_e=\frac{{b}^{2}+\delta}{a},\;\;\; 
 b_e=\frac{{a}^{2}+\delta}{b}
\end{equation*}

Where $\delta=\sqrt{a^4-a^2 b^2+b^4}$. 

\begin{proposition}
The locus of the Excenters the stationary MacBeath Circumellipse $E_6'$ \cite{mw} of the Excentral Triangles.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The center of $E_6'$ is the Symmedian Point $X_6$ \cite[MacBeath Circumconic]{mw}. The Excentral Triangle's $X_6$ coincides with the Mittenpunkt $X_9$ of the reference \cite{etc}. Since over the 3-periodics the vertices of the Excentral lie on an ellipse and its center is stationary, the result follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
The Excentral CB is centered on $X_{168}$, whose trilinears are irrational, and whose locus is non-elliptic.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
$X_{168}$ is the Mittenpunkt of the Excentral Triangle \cite{etc} and its trilinears are irrational\footnote{No Triangle Center whose trilinears are irrational on sidelengths has yet been found whose locus under the 3-periodic family is an ellipse \cite{garcia2020-ellipses}.} on the sidelengths. To determine if its locus is an ellipse we use the algebro-numeric techniques described in \cite{garcia2020-ellipses}. Namely, a least-squares fit of a zero-centered, axis-aligned ellipse to a sample of $X_{168}$ positions of the 3-periodic family produces finite error, therefore it cannot be an ellipse.
\end{proof}

This had been observed in \cite{garcia2020-ellipses} for several irrational centers such as $X_i,i=$13--18, as well as many others. Notice a center may be rational but produce a non-elliptic locus, the emblematic case being $X_6$, whose locus is a convex quartic. Other examples include $X_j,j=$19, 22--27, etc.

\subsection{Anticomplementary Triangle (ACT)}
\label{sec:cb_act}

The ACT is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cb_trio} (top right). The locus of its vertices is clearly not an ellipse.

The ACT is perspective with the reference triangle (3-periodic) at $X_2$ and all of its triangle centers correspond to the anticomplement\footnote{Anticomplement: a 1:2 reflection about $X_2$.} of corresponding reference ones \cite{mw}. The center of the CB of the ACT is therefore $X_7$, the anticomplement of $X_9$. We have shown the locus of $X_7$ to be an ellipse similar to the EB with axes \cite{garcia2020-ellipses}:

\begin{equation*}
\left(a_7,b_7\right)=k\left(a,b\right),\;\;\text{with: }k=\frac{2\delta - {a}^{2}-{b}^{2}}{a^2-b^2}
\end{equation*}

\begin{remark}
The axes of the ACT CB are parallel to the EB and of fixed length.
\end{remark}

This stems from the fact the ACT is homothetic to the 3-periodic.

\subsection{Medial Triangle}

The locus of its vertices is the dumbbell-shaped curve, which at larger $a/b$ is self-intersecting, and therefore clearly not an ellipse, Figure~\ref{fig:cb_trio} (bottom right).

Like the ACT, the Medial is perspective with the reference triangle (3-periodic) at $X_2$. All of its triangle centers correspond to the complement\footnote{Complement: a 2:1 reflection about $X_2$.} of corresponding reference ones \cite{mw}. The center of the CB of the Medial is therefore $X_{142}$, the complement of $X_9$. This point is known to sit midway between $X_9$ and $X_7$.

\begin{remark}
The locus of $X_{142}$ is an ellipse similar to the EB.
\end{remark}

This stems from the fact $X_9$ is stationary and the locus of $X_7$ is an ellipse similar to the EB (above). Therefore its axes will be given by:

\begin{equation*}
\left(a_{142},b_{142}\right)=(a_7,b_7)/2
\end{equation*}

Stemming from homothety of 3-periodic and its Medial:

\begin{remark}
The axes of the Medial CB are parallel to the EB and of fixed length.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Superposition of ACT and Medial}

\begin{proposition}
The Intouchpoints of the ACT (resp. 3-periodic) are on the EB (resp. on the CB of the Medial)
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The first part was proved in \cite[Thm. 2]{reznik2020-ballet}. Because the 3-periodic can be regarded as the ACT of the Medial, the result follows.
\end{proof}

This phenomenon is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cb_act_med_superposed}. Also shown is the fact that $X_i,i=$7, 142, 2, 9, 144 are all collinear and their intermediate intervals are related as $3:1:2:6$. In \cite{etc_central_lines} this line is known as $L(X_2,X_7)$ or $\mathcal{L}_{663}$. $X_{144}$ is the perspector of the ACT and its Intouch Triangle (not shown).
%\begin{align*}
%a(b - c)(b + c - a)x &+ \\
%b(c - a)(c + a - b)y &+ \\
%c(a - b)(a + b - c)z &= 0
%\end{align*}
%I.e., it is L(663), since
%$$X(663) = a(b - c)(b + c - a) ::$$

\subsection{Circumbilliard of the Poristic Family}

The Poristic Triangle Family is a set of triangles (blue) with fixed Incircle and Circumcircle \cite{gallatly1914-geometry}. It is a cousing of the 3-periodic family in that by definition its Inradius-to-Circumradius $r/R$ ratio is constant.

Weaver \cite{weaver1927-poristic} proved the Antiorthic Axis\footnote{The line passing through the intersections of reference and Excentral sidelines \cite{mw}.} of this family is stationary. Odehnal showed the locus of the Excenters is a circle centered on $X_{40}$ and of radius $2R$ \cite{odehnal2011-poristic}. He also showed that over the family, the locus of the Mittenpunkt $X_9$ is a circle whose radius is $2{d^2}(4R+r)$ and center is $X_1 + (X_1 - X_3) (2 R - r)/(4 R + r)$, where $d=|X_1X_3|=\sqrt{R(R-2{r})}$ \cite[page 17]{odehnal2011-poristic}.

Let $\rho=r/R$ and $a_9,b_9$ be the semi-axis lengths of the Circumbilliard a poristic triangle. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cb-poristic}:

\begin{theorem}
The ratio $a_9/b_9$ is invariant over the family and is given by:

\begin{equation*}
\frac{a_9}{b_9}=\sqrt{\frac{\rho^2+2 (\rho+1)\sqrt{1-2\rho} +2}{\rho (\rho+4)}}
\end{equation*}
\noindent where $\rho=r/R$.
\label{thm:poristic}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The following expression for $r/R$ has been derived for the 3-periodic family of an $a,b$ EB \cite[Equation 7]{garcia2020-new-properties}:

\begin{equation}
  \rho = \frac{r}{R} =  \frac{2(\delta-b^2)(a^2-\delta)}{ (a^2-b^2)^2}
\end{equation}
Solving the above for $a/b$ yields the result.
\end{proof}
