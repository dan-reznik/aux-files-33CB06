Amongst the 40k+ centers listed on \cite{etc}, about 4.9k triangle centers lie on the Euler line \cite{etc-central-lines}. Out these, only 226 are fixed affine combinations of $X_2$ and $X_3$. For $k<1000$, these amount to $X_k,k=${\small 2, 3, 4, 5, 20, 140, 376, 381, 382, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 631, 
632}.
